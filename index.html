<h3 id="here-is-what-frankenbot-can-do">Here is what Frankenbot can do!</h3>

<p><br></p>

<h4 id="tape-follow">Tape Follow</h4>

<p>Detecting and following black tape was essential for navigating the
<a href="http://projectlab.engphys.ubc.ca/enph253-2017/competition-2017/">competition surface</a>,
from the start line up the ramp and around the water tank.</p>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong><br />
<img src="/img/portfolio/meetfrankenbot/wheels.png" alt="alt text" title="wheels and gears" /><br />
The drive system consists of two DC motors connected to gears that rotate the wheels around an axle.<br />
Rubber tires (not shown) were used to increase friction, facilitating sharp turns and steep climbs.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/meetfrankenbot/testingHBridge.png" alt="alt text" title="testing H-bridge" /><br />
The DC motors were controlled by the TINAH board through an H-bridge circuit.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/meetfrankenbot/tapefollowing1_400.png" alt="alt text" title="tapefollowing2" /><br />
To detect the black tape, we used QRD reflective sensors that read a low voltage on
highly reflective surfaces, thereby allowing us to distinguish between the white surface and black tape.
Frankenbot has three pairs of QRDs: one pair in the middle (see image above)
for tapefollowing up to the tank,
and two more pairs on either side of the robot (not shown; added to a later prototype)
to be used for tapefollowing around the tank.
The two additional pairs of QRDs helped better position the robot around the tank to facilitate
rescuing the agents on the platforms.</p>

<p>A software based PID (proportinal-integral-drivative) control was used for navigation along the tape.
The PID was tuned through extensive testing, from which we found that the effects of
integral and derivative control were negligeable for this simple system.</p>

<p><strong>Main challenges</strong><br />
Traveling around the tank proved to be the biggest challenge due to the short segments of extra tape
that marked the plank positions. To minimize the risk of the robot traveling down the tape,
we tuned the motor speeds around the tank so that the robot would travel around a circular path by default.<br />
The QRDs also proved to be very sensitive to the positioning, so we had to secure them at their optimal
heights above the ground.</p>

<h4 id="navigate-safely-through-the-armed-door">Navigate safely through the Armed Door</h4>

<p>The second door from the startline is an alarm door to prevent intruders from
entering the compound. Frankenbot has to determine whether the door is armed or disarmed
based on the IR signal being emitted from the door (10 kHz indicates armed, 1 kHz indicates disarmed).</p>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong>
Frankenbot&rsquo;s IR detector is composed of a phototransistor, high and band-pass filters, amplifiers,
and a peak detector. <em>(CIRCUIT DIAGRAM???)</em>
The phototransistor was installed at the front of the robot, right under where the bucket is sitting,
to ensure that no part of the robot is blocking the detector.
The band-pass filter was tuned to allow 1 kHz signal to pass through, producing a detector with a
high voltage output for 1 kHz and a low output for 10 kHz.
The gain of the amplifier was adjusted to increase the sensitivity of the detector even from a
distance, while ensuring that the voltage difference between 10 kHz and 1 kHz is significant.
We succeeded in making a detector that would switch from an output of 0.6V at 10 kHz
to 5.0V at 1kHz.</p>

<p><strong>Main challenges</strong>
The IR levels in the room were affected by the lighting, especially sunlight
since the intensity of the sunlight would change throughout the day.
We addressed this issue by testing and tuning the threshold for the IR detector in
the competition room in advance.<br />
The position of the robot on the competition surface also affected the output from the
IR detector significantly, as the angle of the phototransistor relative to the signal changed
and the doors also blocked the signal. To reduce the variation in IR signals detected,
we decided to program Frankenbot so that he stops right after the first door
(which he detects with the red-coloured collision switches on the side of the chassis)
before detecting the IR signal and making the decision to wait or drive through.</p>

<h4 id="rescue-agents-out-of-water-tank">Rescue Agents out of Water Tank</h4>

<p>The agents are captured in a water tank! Frankenbot has to rescue them out of the tank
before they are drowned in the water!</p>

<h5 id="arm">Arm</h5>

<p>OnShape link</p>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong>
Frankenbot has three servo motors controlling the retrieval arm and claw:
a turning servo for the left-to-right rotation of the arm,
a lifting servo for the up-and-down motion,
and a claw servo for the opening and closing of the claw.
The retrieval arm rests on a turntable, and has a gear at one end of it
which meshes with a gear connected to the lifting servo.
The claw has been decorated with rubber bands that help securely grip the agents
with friction and by molding to the shape of the agents.</p>

<p><strong>Main Challenges</strong><br />
Initially, we had all three servo motors directly connected to the TINAH board,
only to realize that the TINAH was not able to supply enough current.
Therefore we prepared voltage regulators for each servo motor, powered directly from the batteries.<br />
However, even after powering the servo motors with regulators, the arm and claw continued to
flutter and would not stay steady. After consulting an instructor, we learned that
the problem was caused by a lack of a common ground between the power supply (from the battery)
and the PWM signals (from the TINAH) fed to the servos. Adding a grounding wire connection
between the two helped stabilize the arm and claw, and that same day Frankenbot was able to rescue
his first agent from the tank.<br />
Another major issue with the arm design was that the strain on the lifting servo
was enormous. Platforms were created to help hold the arm up in place when not being used,
but still it was evident that the servo motor was fatigued with each use.</p>

<p><em>How it retrieved agents (show video)</em></p>

<h5 id="plank-detection">Plank Detection</h5>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong>
Frankenbot has collision switches with a red polypropylene extension on each side
to tap the servo motors that are located around the tank
(these servos control the platforms and are responsible for drowning the agents by dropping them into the water).
The length of the polypropylene &ldquo;bumpers&rdquo; were tuned by testing how close the robot chassis was
from the tank and servos, and trimmed as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Main Challenges</strong>
The plank detectors were sensitive to any physical change, such as the servo motor mounts being flattened
against the tank or the robot&rsquo;s turn radius being increased or decreased.
Tuning the robot&rsquo;s turn radius was important to ensure that Frankenbot knew
which plank he was passing at any given point in time.</p>

<h4 id="send-agents-down-the-zipline">Send Agents Down the Zipline</h4>

<p>Once rescued from the tank, the six agents had to be sent safely down a metal rod
and out of the captivator</p>

<h5 id="lifter">Lifter</h5>

<p>OnShape link</p>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong><br />
Frankenbot</p>

<p><strong>Main Challenges</strong>
Iterations of pulley size due to torque problems (failing on 6 agents)
torque calculations were done on a winch that had a 20% smaller diameter, therefore needed to increase size of pulley
Size restrictions due to other limitations (arm placement, overall height limit of robot)
Video of it lifting successfully</p>

<h5 id="bucket">Bucket</h5>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong>
Very light
Polypropylene
Hollow Aluminum rod used as the axle
Ball bearings allowed the bucket to roll smoothly
Angle of axle was tuned so that the weight was balanced out
O-rings used to hold the ball bearings in place
Overly big eliminated the risk of agents bouncing or falling out</p>

<p><strong>Main Challenges</strong><br />
- bucket stoppers getting caught on lifter arms</p>

<h5 id="zipline-detection">Zipline Detection</h5>

<p><strong>How we did it</strong><br />
Used collision switches to detect the zipline and adjust accordingly</p>

<p>Very good at correcting (maybe we can trim a video we have into a gif demonstrating this and embed that next to the description)
Show general logic (if this touches rotate this way, etc)</p>

<p>It is arguable that one of the most important lessons we learned was how to work as a <b> team</b>! We were respectful and understanding of one another, carefully considered each other&rsquo;s input and incorporated fun into team building activities!</p>

<h5 id="communication">Communication</h5>

<p>We also learned that communication is incredibly important. We found that constant communication about progress and part development led to a well informed team. We were able to help each other debug since we already knew the status of each concurrent task. We also found it incredibly valuable to communicate effectively with the instructors and TAs. When we were able to explain our designs and difficulties in such a way that people external to our team could understand, we saw that we received much more helpful advice. We also recognize that our instructors and TAs have much more experience than our team combined so we were very open to feedback. Our willingness to learn from our mentors played a huge role in our success.

<p><br>  Messy wirings = <i><b>headaches</b></i>  later <br></p>

<h5 id="connection-troubles">Connection Troubles</h5>

<p>Connections are <b> so </b> important. Ensuring that all of our PCBs passed continuity checks and had proper connections probably saved us hours debugging. Unfortunately we learned the hard way that we should have done this for all connections, including wires and cables connecting between the TINAH microcontroller and PCBs. Insecure connections between connecting cables was the root of many of our electrical problems and we wish we had soldered reliable connections earlier on. <br></p>

<h5 id="facilitating-the-debugging-process-early-on">Facilitating the Debugging process early on</h5>

<p>When soldering PCBs, we made sure that we followed a colour code for wirings and used the same power rail system. This helped us tremendously because all of us could understand the circuits at a moment&rsquo;s glance. This meant that we didn&rsquo;t need to wait for the person who initially designed the circuit to debug it if we ran into problems. We felt it was good practice to leave our circuits tidy enough so that anyone could step in at a moment&rsquo;s notice and have minimal trouble transferring roles.
<br><br> Since we were relatively inexperienced going into this course, we had limited debugging experience. Throughout the summer, however, we developed many techniques for debugging circuits in a timely manner.</p>

<h5 id="tips-and-lessons-learned">Tips and Lessons Learned:</h5>

<p>-First, check continuity between all wirings <br> - Use a DMM to check power for all critical PCBs. Is ground grounded? Is 16V, 16V? <br> - Is there a common ground connected between the microcontroller and PCBs? <br> - Are all of the components still functional? Transistors? Op Amps? <br> <br>

<h3 id="mechanical">Mechanical</h3>

<p><br> <i> <b> Simple </b> </i> is best
<br> <br> We appreciated how easy our chassis was to assemble. The different faces of the chassis snapped together in a tight, secure binding. Although the chassis was strong, it was also easy enough to remove one of the faces and access the circuits beneath. This is something that we are proud of. Unfortunately, we recognize that our winch and arm mechanisms were not as simple to assemble. Both mechanisms took up to an hour to assemble from scratch whereas the chassis took about three minutes. Granted, the arm and winch mechanisms had more components than the chassis, but we recognize that we could have made it simpler. This is something we will keep in mind in future years.</p>

<h5 id="prototyping-and-integration">Prototyping and Integration</h5>

<p>We learned that you can never prototype too early. Although we went through several iterations of our winch and arm mechanisms, we recognize that it is easy to overlook small details that an OnShape or SolidWorks model might miss. <br> <br> Although we were warned, we were astonished to see how easily the modification of a component in one area of the robot often affects another system that is seemingly unrelated. To combat this we made sure we integrated each component separately so that we could isolate problems and debug faster.</p>

<h5 id="tips-and-lessons-learned-1">Tips and Lessons Learned:</h5>

<p>-Simple designs are <i> always </i> better than complicated designs <br> - Easy to assemble mechanisms will save you later <br> - Prototype often and as early as possible <br> - Integrate components one at a time to isolate problems <br>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>

<p><br> Readable code saves <i><b> hours </b></i> later <br></p>

<h5 id="testing-and-debugging">Testing and Debugging</h5>

<p>We tested our software in very small chunks. We would test each addition to the software extensively before adding the next sections. We also divided each section of the competition into different &lsquo;states&rsquo;. Our use of modular code was very effective since it made testing and debugging simpler. We also emphasized the importance of readable code to ensure that all team members could understand it easily and start editing at a moment&rsquo;s notice.
<br> <br> We also attribute a lot of our software success to the use of hardware when debugging. We used the microcontroller&rsquo;s digital LCD display to print statements so that we knew what Frankenbot was trying to do at all times. In addition, we used a buzzer to send a loud &lsquo;beep&rsquo; at critical points in our code. This helped us rule out problems and find the core problems faster.</p>

<h5 id="four-software-experts">Four Software Experts</h5>

<p>All four of us were heavily involved in the software development. This was an asset since all of us could make adjustments when needed. We also appreciated this when debugging since we each caught different bugs in the code.</p>

<h5 id="tips-and-lessons-learned-2">Tips and Lessons Learned:</h5>

<p>-Create modules to isolate tasks and bugs <br> -Write readable code so that others can understand <br> -The more eyes searching for bugs, the better <br> - Test code in small pieces <br> <br>
